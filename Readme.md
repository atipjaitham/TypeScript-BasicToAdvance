# TypyScript basic to advanced ðŸš€

Welcome to the TypyScript basic to advanced project!

This project offers free educational content in the Thai language through KongRukSiam Official. It covers basic TypeScript lessons. You can try learning on your own from this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubAGnfHcYbo&list=PLltVQYLz1BMDQoU7BpXDXvic4yQoLqYO4&index=1&ab_channel=KongRuksiamOfficial).

However, if you're interested in a guided learning experience with hands-on projects, we recommend enrolling in the course offered by KongRukSiam Official. The course includes workshops to enhance your learning experience. You can enroll [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/typescript-basic/?referralCode=DD00DDC52351C21861E3&couponCode=ST6MT42324). ðŸŽ“
